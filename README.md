# Valexy_devops_project
Step 1: Create one Linux instance.
Step 2: In Linux instance install Jenkins and GIT.
Step 3: setup maven
Step 4: Install plugins: git, maven on jenkins
Step 5: install maven:
copy maven url from below link 
https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
#sudo su 
#cd /opt 
#wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.8.4/binaries/apache-maven-3.8.4-bin.tar.gz
Un-zip the package.
# tar -xvzf apache-maven-3.8.4-bin.tar.gz
#ls 
#mv apache-maven-3.8.4 maven maven 
#cd maven
#cd bin 
#ll
# ./mvn -v (to start the maven)

Step 6: make it available for the root user. update under bash_profile  
#cd ~
#pwd
#ll -a
NEED TO ADD THE JAVA PATH AS WELL AS THE  M2  AND M2_HOME PATHS.
#bash_profile (we need to edit it)

#vi bash_profile  
=============================================
# .bash_profile

# Get the aliases and functions
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
        . ~/.bashrc
fi

# User specific environment and startup programs

PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin

export PATH

=================
### fi k niche paste it ###
M2_HOME=/opt/maven
M2=/opt/maven/bin
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-11.0.13.0.8-1.amzn2.0.3.x86_64
# User specific environment and startup programs

PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME:$M2_HOME:$M2

Step 7: 
Now set path for java also 
#sudo su 
#cd jvm 
#find / -name jvm
#cd /usr/lib/jvm
#ll
#find / -name java-11*
copy path (/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-11.0.13.0.8-1.amzn2.0.3.x86_64)

unchecked the box , install automatically 
Name - java-11
JAVA_HOME - /usr/share/doc/java-11-openjdk-11.0.13.0.8-1.amzn2.0.3.x86_64

Now add maven on jenkin UI
Name - maven
MAVEN_HOME - /opt/maven 
Apply and save 

Step 9: 
Tomact installation 

Step 10:
Integration of tomcat with jenkins:::::
Install plugin "deploy to container"
manage jenkins > manage credentials > jenkins > global credentials > add credentials 
kind - username and pw 
id & desc - tomcat_deployer 
uname - deployer 
pw - deployer 
save it 

Step 11: To deploy war file on tomcat
Now, create new job name it - buildanddeploy (maven project)
add git repo 
branch - master 
clean install 
post build action - deploy war/ear to a container 
war file - webapp/
                              ======================== DOCKER SETUP ========================

STEP 1:
>>LINUX INSTANCE >>>INSTALL DOCKER >>START DOCKER CONTAINER>>NORMAL DOCKER COMMANDS FOR PRACTICE 

STEP 2: 
>>Docker image form the docker hub. Initially using docker hub for the image.
>>To rename your host name: 

# vi /etc/hostname

>>Edit the name in the file and :wq
>>In-order to make it active we need to re-boot the system : 
#init6 (instance was not able to start after running this command not recommended to run)

DOCKER PULL: 
>>FIRST WE NEED TO START THE DOCKER SERVICE
#service docker start
#docker pull tomcat
#docker images  >>> tomcat image and image id in O/P
#docker run -d --name tomcat container -p 8081:8080 tomcat
>>Container runs inside your docker host. Need to map it to external port:8081, internally running on port 8080
#docker ps -a (to list containers)
>>To access this container outside form the container: 
>>Take public id: 8081 (need to open this port on the security group: select 8081-9000 to open more posts until 9000)
>>NOW TAKE THE PUBLIC IP :8081

>>FIXING TOMCAT ACCESS ISSUE ON THE BROWSER THAT WE GOT:  "HTTP Status 404 â€“ Not Found"
>>TO CONNECT TO THE CONTAINER: 
#docker exec -it tomcat-container /bin/bash
#ls
#cd webapps.dist
#ls   
>>(The content which is inside this we need to copy it to our "webapps" folder than only we will be able to access our app)
# cp -R * ../webapps
cp=copy
-R=recursive
* in the current directory whatever is there 
.. 1 folder above in webapps directory

NOW WE WILL BE ABLE TO IT FROM THE BROWSER: 
http://3.109.203.23:8081/
You'll be able to see the tomcat webpage by refreshing this page which was throwing an error earlier. 

The changes will be temporary. if the instance is re-created.

STEPS FROM THE TERMINAL ITSELF: 

root@c5d0a32da6b5:~# exit
exit
[root@docker_host ec2-user]# docker ps -a

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES


WE HAVE UPDATED THE CHANGES ONLY ON THE DOCKER CONTAINER. 
WHENEVER WE LAUNCH A NEW CONTAINER WITH THE IMAGE. CHANGES WILL NOT COME UP ON NEW IMAGES. YOU WILL GET THE SAME ERROR : HTTP 404 NOT FOUND.
http://3.109.203.23:8082/
FOR THIS WE LAUNCHED A NEW CONTAINER USING PORT 8082 THIS TIME/EARLIER WE RAN IT ON 8081 (TOMCAT-CONTAINER): 
NEW CONTAINER: TOMCAT-2
docker run -d --name tomcat-2 -p 8082:8080 tomcat:latest

>>TO RESOLVE THIS : 
WE ARE GOING TO CREATE A DOCKER FILE >>PULL TOMCAT IMAGE>>CUSTOMIZATION: COPYING THE FILE FROM WEB-APP DIST TO WEB-APPS LIKE WE DID EARLIER. CONTENT WILL BE ACCESIBLE UNDER WEB-APPS DIRECTORY. FROM HERE IF WE LAUNCH NEW CONTAINER WILL NOT SEE THE SAME ERROR. 

>>>IMPORTANT DOCKER INSTRUCTIONS: 
FROM, RUN, CMD , ENTRYPOINT, WORKDIR, COPY, ADD, EXPOSE, ENV
SEE SIMPLE DEVOPS PROJECT GIT HUB REPO FOR DETAILED INFORMATION.

INSTALLING TOMCAT ON CENTOS: 
1. PULL CENTOS FROM DOCKER HUB                           >>>>>FROM 
2. INSTALL JAVA                                                                >>>>>>RUN

---===============DOCKER 2==================

SCRIPT TO LAUNCH AN INSTANCE: 
#!/bin/bash
# sudo yum update -y
# sudo yum install docker.io
# sudo service docker start
# service docker status


STEP 2: 
>> To rename your host name >>
# vi /etc/hostname

>>Edit the name in the file and :wq
>>In-order to make it active we need to re-boot the system :

STEP 3:
>>DOCKER PULL >>

>>FIRST WE NEED TO START THE DOCKER SERVICE:
#service docker start
#docker pull tomcat
#docker images  >>> tomcat image and image id in O/P

NEED TO CREATE A DOCKER USER:
#useradd dockeradmin
#passwd dockeradmin   ~~docker
# usermod -aG docker dockeradmin
RUN THE BELOW COMMAND TO EDIT THE PERMISSIONS: (Commenting and un-commenting)
#vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
#NEED TO RE-START THE SERVICES: 
#service sshd reload    (Redirecting to /bin/systemctl reload sshd.service will show up in O/P)

NOW OPEN THE DUPLICATE SESSION: 
# su dockeradmin
IT WILL ASK FOR A PASSWD FOR THE DOCKER ADMIN 

NOW NEED TO INTEGRATE THIS DOCKER HOST WITH THE JENKINS, NEED TO INSTALL A PLUGIN FOR THAT: 
>GO TO JENKINS DASHBOARD  
> GO TO MANAGE JENKINS  
> MANAGE PLUGINS: LOOK FOR "Publish Over SSH"
> INSTALL WITHOUT RESTART

ADDING SSH SERVER:
MANAGE JENKINS >>> CONFIGURE SYSTEM 
-SCROLL DOWN TO MAKE THE CHANGES.

NOW OUR APP IS DEPLOYED ON A CONTAINER. BUT WHAT IF THAT CONTAINER FAILS??? 
kubernetes ceates a new pod in case of any failures.
SO, FOR THAT WE ARE USING KUBERNETES FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF OUR WEBSITE.
Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)

PRE-REQUSITE: 
We will be creating one ec2 instance to setup our kubernetes on amazon eks with the help of AWS CLI
1. AN EC2 INSTANCE.
2. INSTALL AWSCLI LATEST VERSION.

ADD CLUSTER>>CREATE
Name: 
- Not editable after creation.

Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, you must install and configure the following tools and resources that you need to create and manage an Amazon EKS cluster.

    AWS CLI â€“ A command line tool for working with AWS services, including Amazon EKS. This guide requires that you use version 2.4.9 or later or 1.22.30 or later. For more information, see Installing, updating, and uninstalling the AWS CLI in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide. After installing the AWS CLI, we recommend that you also configure it.

===================NOW CREATING AN IAM ROLE =========
>> GO TO IAM CONSOLE.
>> CREATE ROLE
>> IAM FULL ACCESS, EC2 FULL ACCESS, CLOUDFORMATION FULL ACCESS.
>> CREATE ROLE
>> ROLE NAME :  EKS_CTL_ROLE
>>  GO TO EC2 INSTANCE AND ASSIGN THE ROLE CREATED TO THIS INSTANCE.
 ----->>GO TO ACTIONS>>SECUTY>>EDIT ROLE>>SELECT THE ROLE FROM THE DROPDOWN MENU

======================================================================================================

NOW GO TO GIT HUB REPO : kubernetes_setup_using_eksctl.md
>>>Create your cluster and nodes.
>>>Go to cd tmp and run below commands:

======================================================================================================

#cd /tmp
# eksctl create cluster --name devcluster --region us-east-1 --node-type t2.small 

======================================================================================================

DELETE THE CLUSTER: 
FOR DELETING IT FIRST WE NEED TO DELETE: 
VPC / SUBNETS ETC IF DOING IT FROM THE CONSOLE.
eksctl delete cluster --name devcluster --region us-east-1 --node-type t2.small 

GO TO CLOUDFORMATION TO CHECK IF SOMETHING IS BEING CREATED OR NOT....... THIS PROCESS WILL TAKE ALMOST 20-25 MINUTES TO BE COMPLETED.

AFTER CREATING THE CLUSTER WE NEED TO CHECK IF THE NODES ARE CREATED OR NOT.
2:27 mins lec 46
# kubectl get nodes
# kubectl create deployment  demo-nginx --image=nginx --replicas=2 --port=80
>deployment.apps/demo-nginx created

TO CHECK IF THE DEPLOYMENT IS CREATED OR NOT: 
# kubectl get deployment

TO CHECK IF REPLICA SET IS CREATED OR NOT
# kubectl get replicaset
# kubectl get pods

TO DELETE THE PODS:
# kubectl delete pod <pod_name>

THIS COMMAND IS USED TO SEE EVERYTHING: 
# kubectl get all

NOW NEED TO EXPOSE THE DEPLOYMENT AS A SERVICE:
#kubectl expose deployment demo-nginx --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer
>service/demo-nginx exposed
# kubectl get all

TO GET THE EXTERNAL IP OF LOAD BALANCER SERVICE:

a415e5629ec124dafafc675479515b40-1857107097.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
o/p: Welcome to nginx!
ALSO CHECK IN THE LOAD BALANCERS TO SEE WETHER IT IS CREATED OR NOT.
NOW WE HAVE DONE EVERYTHING MANUALLY. WE WILL RUN IT AUTOMATICALLY BY CREATING A MANIFEST FILE JUST LIKE ANSIBLE PLAYBOOKS.

NOW DELETE THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE CREATED MANUALLY.
#kubectl delete deployment demo-nginx 
# kubectl delete service/demo-nginx
# kubectl get pods
TO CHECK
>>LOAD BALANCER DELETED.
# vi pod.yml

select: One-page API Reference for Kubernetes v1.23
select Pod v1 core from the left hand side menu
refer the example
GOOGLE: 
"pod manifest file kubernetes"
select create link on google page..
look for : Create a static pod 

Now create vi pod.yml file and below content in yml file.

USING LABELS AND SELECTOR: LECTURE 49

IF WE CHECK OUR WEBSITE ON BROWSER WITH THE HELP OF ALB ENDPOINT WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OUR APP BECAUSE WE HAVE COMMENTED THE LABELS. 
IN REAL SCENARIO THERE CAN BE SEVERAL PODS. HOW WILL SERVICE DECIDE WHICH POD IT HAS TO SEND THE TRAFFIC. SO FOR SENDING TRAFFIC TO A PARTICULAR POD WE NEED TO GIVE THEM LABELS.

POD CREATED AND CREATED SERVICE IN LAST STEPS.

NOW WE WILL HAVE TO UPDATE THE POD.YML FILE.
UN-COMMENT THE 2 LINES WE HAVE COMMENTED IN THE EARLIER STEPS. (LABELS)

# kubectl delete pod <pod_name>
AND NOW IF WE CHECK USING BELOW COMMAND
# kubectl get pods
#WE WILL SEE THt there are still three pods running. because after deleting one pod. another pod is created automatically as we mentioned in the file.

LECT: 52
NOW WE WILL INTEGRATE THIS WITH JENKINS AND ANSIBLE.

HOW TO INEGRATE KUBE CLUSTER WITH ANSIBLE:
>>CREATE AND ADMINUSER
>>ADD ANSADMIN USER TO SUDOERS FILE
>>ENABLE PASROD BASED LOGIN
ON ANSIBLE NODE:
> ADD TO HOSTS FILE
> COPY SSH KEYS
> TEST THE CONNECTION
ONCE THIS IS DONE WE WILL BE WRITING THE ANSIBLE PLAYBOOK .
NOW, GO TO THE BOOTSTRAP SERVER AND ADD THE ANSADMIN USER
# adduser ansadmin
# passwd ansadmin      << ansible is the password>
# visudo
EDIT THIS SECTION IN THAT FILE:  AND :WQ
## Allow root to run any commands anywhere 
root    ALL=(ALL)ALL
ansadminALL=(ALL)      ALL
# vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
## To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!
#PasswordAuthentication no
#PermitEmptyPasswords no
PasswordAuthentication yes
# systemctl restart sshd

NOW GO TO YOUR ANSIBLE SERVER: 
# sudo su - ansadmin
# cd /opt/docker
# ls
# mv regapp.yml create_image_reapp.yml
# ls
You will see the changes here. NOW RENAME ANOTHER FILE.
# mv deploy_regapp.yml docker_deployment.yml
# ls
NOW GOT TO THE ANSIBLE SERVER AND MAKE SURE YOU ARE LOGGED IN AS A ROOT USER NOT ANS ADMIN USER. 
WE WILL NOW EDIT THE FILE.
# vi /etc/ansible/hosts
NOW ADD THE KUBERNETES GROUP, WITH IT'S PRIVATE IP: 
[kubenetes]
172.31.34.193
:wq

ANSIBLE SERVER: 
# ssh-copy-id 172.31.34.193   (IP ADDRESS OF EKS BOOTSTRAP SERVER. PRIVATE IP)
NOW TRY TO LOGIN INTO KUBERNETES SERVER VIA ANSIBLE SERVER: 
# ssh-copy-id 172.31.34.193    <private ip of the kubernetes server)
NOW TO CHECK THE CONNECTION WE NEED TO RUN THE BELOW COMMAND: 
#  ansible all -a uptime   
O/P: (THREE IP'S SHOULD SHOW UP HERE)
ONLY 2 IPS WERE SHOWING UP EARLIER BECAUSE OUR DOCKER SERVER WAS STOPPED. ONCE WE STARTED THE SERVER ALL THREE SHOWED UP.
#

=====================================================================================
NOW DELETE THE RESOURCES CREATED PREVIOUSLY ON EKS_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER
#cd /tmp
# kubectl delete -f regapp-service.yml && kubectl delete -f regapp-deployment.yml
# kubectl get all   <to check the deletion process>

On EKS_Server 
move all the .yml files from /tmp to root with the help of following commands
#mv <.yml> ~

Now, Run the playbooks to build resources 
#ansible-playbook -i /opt/docker/hosts kube_deploy.yml
>> it will create all the pods and deployment on eks server
# ansible-playbook -i /opt/docker/hosts kube_service.yml
>>it will create service on eks server 
=====================================================================================

NOW WE ARE CREATING JENKINS DEPLOYMENT JOB FOR KUBERNETES: 

DEPLOYING AS APOD. 
USING JENKINS NOW RATHER THAN USING ANSIBLE FOR RUNNING THE PLAYBOOKS. 

JUMP IN TO YOUR JENKINS SERVER. 

CREATE NEW
NAME: Deploy_On_kubernetes
Select free style job.
Got to Post build action.
select : send files or execute commands over SSH

APPLY AND SAVE

GOT TO KUBE SERVER
kubectl delete deployment.apps/vj0555-regapp
